# Plan of Action

- (DONE) Initialize NodeJS Project                                 
- (DONE) Initialize the first view (front-end)
- (DONE) Create a "zoom" room ID
- (DONE) Add the ability to view my own video
- (DONE) Add the ability to allow others to stream their video
- (DONE) Add styling
- (DONE) Add the ability to chat
- (DONE) Add mute / stop video buttons 

Notes:
- ejs is embedded javaScript (helps move variables between front and back end)
- uuid was used to generate random unique room IDs
- socketio is a library used for real time communication (with http you can make requests to server and the server can respon, but the server cannot make requests to you)
- used peerjs (peertopeer) to generate unique user IDs 
- used bootstrap and fontawesome to help with styling (font and icons)
- used jquery (mandatory for bootstrap)
